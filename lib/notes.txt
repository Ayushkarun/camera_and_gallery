added 3 package

camera
Provides tools to work with the cameras on the device.

path_provider
Finds the correct paths to store images.

path
Creates paths that work on any platform.

For android, You must update minSdkVersion to 21 (or higher).

Step 2: Get List of Available Cameras
‚úÖ Why this step is important:
Before you can use any camera, you need to:

Ask the system what cameras are available.

Select one camera (usually rear-facing).

Pass it to your app so it can create a controller for that camera.

üß† Step-by-Step Explanation:
‚úÖ 1. WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
 
WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
What it does: Initializes Flutter before doing async work in main().

Why needed: You are calling an async function (availableCameras()), so Flutter must be fully set up first.

If you forget this: The app will crash with an error like ‚ÄúServices binding not initialized‚Äù.

Import camera package
 Explanation:
dart:io: For file saving.

camera: For using the device camera.

path_provider: To find folders on the device (like temp or app storage).

path: Helps you manage file names and extensions.

gallery_screen.dart: To show saved images in a gallery.

üîπ late CameraController _cameraController;
What it is:
This is the main controller used to manage the camera.

It's a class provided by the camera package.

Why you need it:
You use it to initialize the camera, start/stop the preview, and take pictures.

You‚Äôll pass it to CameraPreview(_cameraController) to show the live camera feed.

Why late?
Because you can't initialize it until you get the list of available cameras (asynchronously in _initializeCamera()).
